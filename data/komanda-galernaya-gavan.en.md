     The main location of the Galernaya Harbour team was the eponymous water object. Galernaya Harbour is a small bay on the Western part of Vasilievsky island. 
     The history of this place dates back to the beginning of the XVIII century and is closely connected to the history of urban planification of Saint Petersburg. 
     However, not all local residents are aware of this fact. Thus, at the time of the start of the team, some of them did not realize that there was a large amount
     of water within walking distance from their home. Therefore, the team of Galernaya Harbour decided to focus on the development of the local community, 
     involving residents in the joint process of exploring the territory.

**What has been done?**

The team members completed their main task: they managed to start a dialogue between the locals and the Harbour. So residents began to think about what the city, 
public space, and the Harbour in which they live could be like.

By organizing events and engaging locals, the team members expanded residents’  understanding of the place: the team showed the Harbour as a part of history, 
as an object of cultural heritage. Together with the residents, team members reflected on the Harbour’s identity. They also told children about the culture of 
behavior, about ecology and recycling. Moreover, team members expanded children’s understanding of water use, tried to 
instill awareness of its value.

The Galernaya Harbour team also managed to establish links with friendly projects and organizations, thereby increasing the credibility of various active societies 
and activists as such. For example, The Cultural Forpost Society found its place in the debarcader, so now they also hold their events for local residents: canoe 
them around the Harbour, etc. The Nutschool — the studio of creative intelligence — also found out about the Harbour and held several master classes with children 
there.

Besides, team members acted as intermediaries between the Harbour tenant and local residents. The tenant spoke about his plans for the coastal area and, happily, 
found much understanding among the locals.
