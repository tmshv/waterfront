# Waterfront Open Call for Art Projects 


**The Street Art Research Institute and the Danish Cultural Institute in Saint Petersburg are happy to announce an open call 
for art projects.**

**The goal** of the project is to attract (through urban-oriented art practices and public art ) the active attention 
of citizens to the problem of using embankments and the development of urban coastal areas as modern public spaces.

**Open Call terms:** June 16 July 15, 2020 (acceptance of applications ends at 15.07.2020 at 23: 59 Moscow time).

**Implementation:** August 2020 â€” July 2021 (depends on the epidemiological situation).

**Who can apply:** individual authors and / or creative groups working with different forms of artistic practices*.

**Participants'geography:** North-Western region of the Russian Federation (Saint Petersburg, Leningrad, Arkhangelsk, 
Murmansk regions, Republic of Karelia). We also welcome representatives of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland, Norway, 
Finland and Sweden). 

  *NB! Applications from other regions can be accepted if at least one of the team members is representative 
  of the North-West of the Russian Federation or a Northern Country.*

**Implementation:** at one of the locations by the water side in St. Petersburg. We also accept online projects 
that can later be implemented offline, i.e. in the urban space.

**Production budget:** up to 80 thousand Rubles per project.

*The winners will be invited to participate in a group study trip of the Waterfront project to Finland, 
Sweden and Estonia (the travel period will be specified later).*

**Selection process:**

the organizers expect to select from three to five projects for implementation; the selection will be made 
by the organizing Committee, consisting of the Waterfront project team, which includes experts in the field of urbanism, 
architecture, art history, sociology, ecology, art management, consultants for the development of public spaces, 
as well as of active participants in the previous stages of the project.

**What kind of projects do we expect? In order to facilitate the tasks of applicants, we offer several specific 
areas (nominations), so the applicants can choose one or more of them:**

**1. Universal design solution (replicable and scalable) that solves a specific task: to mark the location of a city 
either lost or existing boat station or recreation areas near the water. The information pointer method must be original 
in terms of idea and design; it must be visible, identifiable, vandal-resistant, and informative.**

*Context:*

*The modern city grows out of history and its traditions, as the city is a few generations of residents who have lived 
a whole life and remember the realities of their time, which they treat as a value. Moreover, young people, as a rule, 
do not know much about the everyday history and practice of city life in the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and even in the 70s and 80s. 
Meanwhile, in this Soviet time, the municipality and city services were similarly puzzled by the organization of leisure 
and recreation places for citizens, where they could relax after working days among the wildlife, without going far beyond 
the city limits. Sports and outdoor activities were also among the priorities. One of the opportunities for a pleasant 
and useful weekend in the maritime city were, of course, the water walks. For this purpose, boat stations were created 
on rivers, channels and lakes with a fleet of oar boats and the possibility of their hourly rental. This tradition was 
seriously damaged in the post-Soviet period. That is why the organizers chose former and currently operating boat stations 
as possible locations for public art objects. Temporary objects can become new points of attraction for both local residents 
and tourists.*

**2. Local art intervention "in the area" in the format of "improvising", tied to a specific place and solving a specific 
problem of the selected space (at the  discretion of the author).**

*Context:*

*Modern street art is puzzled not only by the author's personal self-expression, but also by social projects that 
analyze disadvantages and inconveniences for residents of the neighborhood, developing necessary and precise interventions 
that allow to quickly solve the problem or at least identify it and move towards its possible solution with the help of 
local active residents or engineering district services. This is what we call "improvising".*

**3. Art projects that initiate social communication, that is, involve citizens in cooperation and dialogue with each other 
in order to "inhabit" public spaces near the water.**

*Context:*

*Residents of St. Petersburg are usually described as people who are not particularly open and do not tend 
to communicate with strangers. However, only a friendly local community is able to take responsibility to promptly 
raise and solve the problems of the neighborhood. In order to organize and launch such an activity, there are various 
social mechanisms. We offer to develop and test them in practice.*

**A list of possible locations for which Waterfront conducted research and for which it is possible to obtain
(the organizers will provide on request) an overview of analytical information:**

  - Chernaya Rechka River ( between the Chernorechenskiy bridge and  Starobelskaya street);

  Participants can choose the location by their own.


**APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS**

**The project format** can be anything that can be implemented in an open urban space (on a temporary basis, if it is an object),
taking into account the conditions and challenges that we have faced in 2019 / 2020:

  - pandemic
  - the difficulty of negotiation of stationary art objects in an urban environment
  - search for new forms of communication in the period of isolation

**The application must contain:**
  - applicant's profile / cv
  - description of the idea / concept
  - visualization / sketch (if it is an object)
  - short script (if it is a performative art)
  - location (if it means a specific place in the city)
  - detailed estimates and technical rider
