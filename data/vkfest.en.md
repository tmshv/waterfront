# VKFest

The concept of the festival is simple: the largest social network in Russia goes beyond online for two days to recreate itself in real life.

VK Fest is St. Petersburg's largest open-air and one of the largest festivals in the country. In 2018, more than 90 thousand people visited it, for which 350 interactive sites worked. 1.7 million people watched the live broadcast on VKontakte.
