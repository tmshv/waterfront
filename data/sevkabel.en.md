# Public space "Sevcable Port"

The new urban project "Sevcable Port" continues to grow rapidly. Opened just two years ago, on the territory of the former Siemens & Haslke cable factory, it clearly seeks to become the main event venue in St. Petersburg, competing with New Holland.
The main idea of ​​this project was to return the water area back to the inhabitants of Vasilievsky Island. The company plans to continue work on the development of the coastline and turn it into a comfortable and accessible place for recreation for all residents.
Since June 2019, the Sevcable Port team, in cooperation with the motor company Neva Travel, opened the first shipping route connecting the city center and Sevcable.
