# A swim around the Peter and Paul Fortress

A long-term campaign from the company X-waters, which aims to instill a love of sports and an active lifestyle outside the pools and the gym. X-waters are actively promoting the idea of including water spaces in the daily lives of citizens.

Competitions are held not only in St. Petersburg, but also in other cities of Russia and abroad. Last yearâ€™s swim around the Peter and Paul Fortress was attended by over 400 people.
