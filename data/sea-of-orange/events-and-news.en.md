## ORANGE NIGHT

The Sea of Orange project was launched in December 2019. The main place of its action is the so-called Amber beach in the North-East of the city of Lomonosov. This is where the first meeting of the participants took place. The Waterfront project team, architects from the bureau Observatorium and residents of the city, all together, during the three-day workshop, we explored the coastline of Lomonosov, discussed the history of the beach and possible options for its further development. Each of the participants created their own ‘map of ideas’ and presented their own vision of how the beach area might look in the future.

On May, 22 2020,  an open [online presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fta_muHcm0) of the project was held. Project producer Albina Motor and the Observatorium architects Lieven Poutsma and Ruud Reutelingsperger presented the concept of the art object to be installed on the beach. The sketches of the object are based on the results of the winter workshop. After the presentation, the project was discussed with the residents of Lomonosov and other participants of the online conference.

Exactly one year later, on May 22, 2021, we are happy to present the results of our work. On this day, a large-scale land-art object Orange Dune will open on the Amber Beach of Lomonosov and a picnic festival will be held.

For the presentation of the project, we chose the format of a public picnic — barbecues will be installed on the beach and access to drinking water will be provided so that participants can prepare their own food. Garbage collection areas and latrines will also be organized. We want these simple conditions to allow all participants to have a good time in nature and relax by the water, to communicate with each other and with the project organizers. And for a festive atmosphere, we have prepared a program of different events for the whole day.

**Program:**

**15:00-16:00** Public talk about the city's public embankments with the initiator and producer of the project Albina Motor, the Dutch partners, the president of the Oranienbaum Marine Festival Evgeny Zakharov and the entire project team. Presentation of the public summer environmental program from the  "Baltic Friends".

**16: 00-18:00** Philosophical walk with art critic Dmitry Pilikin.

**16:00-16:30** Performance by choreographer Anna Klimakova accompanied by Cuban musician and composer Yoel Gonzalez: *"Water moves, it takes different forms, freezes. We consider water as a substance that affects a person. Water calms, takes away unnecessary things, washes away everything and gives life".*

**17:00-20:30** Performance of Somatik Sound System label musicians.

**20:30-21:00** Garbage collection on the Amber Beach.
