In our part of the world it is evident that there is contemporary public sculpture, that the arts adress human rights or the UN sustainable development goals or climate change and new ecology. It is somewhat taken for granted that the arts are involved in these issues. Therefore maybe even ‘undangerous’. In and around St Petersburg however it is not so evident. Which means that Observatorium also has to re-invent themselves. In a place where public art and a gentle form of activism is not so common we need to find ways of incorporating, for us unknown local culture and local visual expressions.
