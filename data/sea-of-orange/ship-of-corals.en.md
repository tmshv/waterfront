A ship where the corals, the waves and the flows of the wind are mixed and as a result converted into the ship. Also, there should be some kind of a place that would protect two or three people from the 'storm' (strong wind, heavy rain and so on)

## QUESTION #7

**Olga S.**<br/>
Nature is very important to me, it helps to relax, to let the anxiety go away, it is aethetically pleasant and it makes me happy. And Lomonosov is good because there is a lot of greenery and clean air. It's nice to live here in the summer -you can swim, sunbathe and ride a bike, walk in the park and there are few people around.

**Fedor**<br/>
Nature is what will remain after me and after all of us. It is more sophisticated than any of the most ingenuine human intentions and inventions. Probably, I feel so because of the extreme beauty of the sky, which rarely shows how beautiful it is.

**x2**<br/>
I treat nature as a friend who will always help and share strength and calmness.

**Vladimir Zhuravlev**<br/>
All St. Petersburg residents usually miss the sun over the winter, so they go abroad to resorts, but I do not like to relax in resorts. I feel good alone. I just go somewhere 10 minutes away from Lomonosov, where there is no people, and I sunbathe in the tall grass, collect willow-herb, raspberries, and later mushrooms. I take fotos of wildlife, flowers and birds.


## QUESTION #8

**Olga S.**<br/>
The city is necessary, it it is impossible to live without it. But it is more about work, socialization, culture, tension and restrictions. I like cities, but not too big, like Moscow - it's just vast, and there is a difficult rhythm of life. Saint Petersburg, in my opinion, is much more pleasant for life, but, of course, our climate is not always good.

**Fedor**<br/>
To the city, to St. Petersburg. To my image of it. I have thought many times that it is beautiful as a work of art, and ideal as a basis for a dramatic work of art, especially for a literary one, but rather dismissive in relation to a person. But it was conceived this way. In my opinion, it is classic and cold and does not allow an imperfect person to approach it.

**x2**<br/>
If we are talking about Lomonosov, than it is very cozy and diverse. In general,however, I feel myself uncomfortable in the cities because of the large number of people and noise.

**Svetlana Zhuravleva**<br/>
I treat Lomonosov with love and thrill--this is my small homeland.

**Vladimir Zhuravlev**<br/>
I study the history of the city of Oranienbaum, write articles and books about it. I participate and even organize environmental round tables, where we discuss different ways how we can protect the city. I participate in various scientific and creative projects, although recently, less and less often. Because I'm focused on my projects. I have not much time, but there are lot of plans for the future.

**Maria Zhuravleva**<br/>
I feel myself in the city like in my own apartment â€“ safe and calm. The longer I live here, the more I love every corner. A walk through the streets gives strength and inspiration, the view of the bay from a high ledge inspires me.
