Once upon a time on the waterfront of Lomonosov...

... all the rusty gates and buoys, old tugs, rickety wooden sheds, logs, and other incomprehensible objects abandoned by time and fadely disappeared. The Sidorovsky canal has been transformed, the traditionally yellow building of the former sea station of the passenger pier has sparkled with new windows, shady alleys for pedestrians and paths for cyclists have appeared. Of course, there were no cars in the green zone of the Sidorovsky canal and the beach, they all remained in the parking lot. Mums with strollers walked along the alley in front of the beach, elderly people sat on benches and looked at the water that was always quiet in this corner of the Gulf of Finland, admiring the horizon. A few people on the sports field were working out on exercise machines, and a few more were playing volleyball. On the playground, kids were engaged in their exciting business, and someone with their mothers went to the sea shore to wet their feet, join nature, look at the gulls swinging on the water. People sunbathed on the shore and admired the view: ships, boats, and the opposite shore. And from the cloud, two angels looked at all this with curiosity....and they liked it!
