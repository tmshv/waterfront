Once upon a time on the waterfront of Lomonosov...

... all the rusty gates and buoys, old tugs, rickety wooden sheds, logs, and other incomprehensible objects abandoned by time and fadely disappeared. The Sidorovsky canal has been transformed, the traditionally yellow building of the former sea station of the passenger pier has sparkled with new windows, shady alleys for pedestrians and paths for cyclists have appeared. Of course, there were no cars in the green zone of the Sidorovsky canal and the beach, they all remained in the parking lot. Mums with strollers walked along the alley in front of the beach, elderly people sat on benches and looked at the water that was always quiet in this corner of the Gulf of Finland, admiring the horizon. A few people on the sports field were working out on exercise machines, and a few more were playing volleyball. On the playground, kids were engaged in their exciting business, and someone with their mothers went to the sea shore to wet their feet, join nature, look at the gulls swinging on the water. People sunbathed on the shore and admired the view: ships, boats, and the opposite shore. And from the cloud, two angels looked at all this with curiosity....and they liked it!

## QUESTION #5

**Olga S.**<br/>
For me, the most surprising thing is that the city was not captured by the Germans during the World War II. The city did play great role in the defense of Leningrad. It's a small town after all, and I'm proud that it and its inhabitants were so resilient and strong. Thanks to this, the palaces were not destroyed, as in Peterhof, which has been completely restored.

**x1**<br/>
The first thing that I heard about Oranienbaum (Lomonosov) was that somewhere here there is a huge stone head sticking out of the ground. That there were huge Russian slides being built. That Lomonosov has never actually lived here.

**Fedor**<br/>
The most amazing thing...but the thing is that it actually happened not in the Lomonosov, but in the area nearby, which is officially considered as a part of the city... So, the most crazy thing is that there were mummified burrials in Martyshkino, and that even the horses of
Peter the Third of Holstein was buried in a similar way. It's just something
out of the ordinary. And a couple of mummies can now be seen in
our local history Museum.

**Svetlana Zhuravleva**<br/>
When I learned that many famous people were in Oranienbaum: Pushkin, Nekrasov, Levitan, Shishkin, Dumas, Chaliapin, Komissarzhevskaya, and many others, even Lenin and Stalin, and Mikhail Lomonosov has never been here!

**Maria Zhuravleva**<br/>
The stories about ghosts in the palaces of Lomonosov or the skeleton found during the excavations of the Menshikov Palace. The amazing thing is that Oranienbaum-Lomonosov always had some independence, isolation and face, it had never been bend or won. It is surprising that the high ledge along the coast is the shore of the ancient sea, that blocks of granite are everywhere, and that the water in taps is underground water that flows from the ancient underground layers.


## OBSERVATION #2

![](/assets/sea-of-orange/sorange_si_12.jpg)

During a lecture Observatorium introduced the term Arti-tecture. It explains the core of our work. The projects are a work of imagination (art) and have a function (architecture). They are landmarks in their environment whether it is urban or rural. They are meeting- and viewing points and talk not only about history but much more about the future. They are a tool for place-making. The world is changing constantly at an even more rapid pace. Observatorium creates spaces to look at the changing world around you (if you move you don’t see) and raise curiosity for the world around us. After the lecture a young female architect proclaimed; I want to be the first Russian Arti-tect!


## QUESTION #6

**Tatiana Kiskina**<br/>
I was here this summer with other urban workshop, not by my own. I liked that the beach is so close to the railway station. It seems that is cool to have a place to relax right in the city and not to go 100km away from it. I was unable to see the entire city, but it is so sad to see all these abandoned buildings around.

**Fedor**<br/>
I rarely go to the beach. Only a few times a year.
Either I walk with friends, or I come to wander alone. To admire the bright St. Petersburg sky and to look at the colorful ships with containers? to feel the warm summer wind.

**Vladimir Zhuravlev**<br/>
In summer, when the weather is sunny, I come here by bike to sunbathe in the center of the mound of sand..
I never swim in the bay because water is dirty. I only sunbathe in a thicket of sea buckthorn. There are never other sunbathers, so you can sunbathe without clothes. Usually all sunbathers sit on the shore, fry kebabs, drink beer and look at the bay. And I look at the sea buckthorn, the sky and the sun.

**Maria Zhuravleva**<br/>
I always come here in August, during the Oranienbaum Sea festival. And once a year, to have some long, friendly conversation.
I talk to people, look at the sea. Once I was lucky enough to spend the night in a tent, but it is uncomfortable without the festival around because it seems unsafe.
