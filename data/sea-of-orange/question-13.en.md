**Tatiana Kiskina**<br/>
I like the idea that the beach can be free of past history, and can be filled with stories of the future
Olga S.
As a place of rest with a view of the bay, with benches, bike paths, promenade, perhaps, a marina, like in small towns in Finland.

**x1**<br/>
As a place where there is no conflict between people and nature, they complement each other. As a place where you can come and have a quiet time, relax from the city clutter. Where is clean air and you feel yourself comfortable. Everything is extremely eco-friendly, natural and approachable.

**x2**<br/>
Clean and neat.

**Svetlana Zhuravleva**<br/>
With a promenade, with benches and playgrounds for children, maybe with a sports field for adults. It should be clean and worthy of the city.

**Vladimir Zhuravlev**<br/>
I think the bests scenarios is that the Master Plan should have a recreational zoning â€“ a recreation and sports area without major facilities. How exactly this area would develop, it does not matter much, as long as there are no industrial zones. I am satisfied with the wild sea buckthorn thickets in the center of the beach, and the clean beach of new sand (now this sand is taken from the railway embankment of the military railroad), let there be some corners for sea sports and recreation. I would like to see yachting development. There should be old ships here, and even a Naval Museum on the water.
Maria Zhuravleva
There could be a great yacht marina with everything you need for yachting! And no sewer pipe, please!
