Once a lighthouse appeared on the coast of Lomonosov. It was built very quickly and somehow unnoticed by the city residents. Strange cheerful people came and built everything in a couple of days. Everyone was very surprised, they began to find out who was responsible for the construction and what to do with it, and while they were finding out, other people began to come to the lighthouse. And they liked it. It symbolized the way, truth, hope, and many other things. You can't get close to an ordinary lighthouse, they are closed to people, and this one stood hospitably, waiting for guests. He shone, of course, more metaphorically. But everyone could climb it and look into the distance for a long time. And people began to come, even from afar, to see such a miracle. Therefore, residents of Lomonosov decided not to disassemble the lighthouse, but to strengthened it and the area around it. They built paths, benches, and an embankment around it, and finally figured out how to remove the ill-fated pipe. The townspeople loved this place and all together cared for it. Everyone tried to contribute, making the coast better and better. There was enough place for everyone, including yachtsmen. And one day people looked around and saw how much they could do together and how this place had changed, and they liked it!
