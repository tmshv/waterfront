Once upon a time on the waterfront of Lomonosov...

...there was a large flood that affected the lives of all local residents, destroyed the cultural heritage, but almost did not affect nature. One of the consequences of this flood was an unprecedented number of marine animals washed ashore. Everyone, including the animals themselves, was extremely concerned about this situation, so to make everyone a little happier, they (animals) decided to build a half-wooden half-water castle. Since everyone knew that it would quickly collapse, they decided to build it so beautiful that it would always remain in everyone's memory! They built it and, to everyone's surprise, the castle was constantly changing over time - it was not static, it was dynamic, as nature itself! And when the castle disappeared, no one was very upset, because they knew that they could create another, even better...

...and they liked it!
