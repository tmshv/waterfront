Once upon a time on the waterfront of Lomonosov...

...unusual people came. They didn’t speak Russian, wandered around the beach, watched the waves, saw the sewer pipe, stretching from the city to the bay, and thought how nice it would be to build in this place a beautiful fountain. But they didn’t want to make an ordinary fountain, they decided to make an unusual one. The fountain, which would relate to the military history of the city. So the detail of this fountain were supposed to move and make different sounds.

...and they liked it!
