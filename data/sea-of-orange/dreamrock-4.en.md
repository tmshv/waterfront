Just as crazy as the Russian slide in the Palace Garden. Why a banana? Because it will remind people that they should keep their beach clean. It raises attention for the pollution of the environment. Who wants to live in another personâ€™s trash? A bright image of a discarded banana peel, which is a symbol of garbage that is thrown beside a garbage bin. The well-known property of banana peel for sliding becomes a metaphor and the basis for creating a slide for children, which would bring joy and make you think at the same time.
