**Olga S.**<br/>
Nature is very important to me, it helps to relax, to let the anxiety go away, it is aethetically pleasant and it makes me happy. And Lomonosov is good because there is a lot of greenery and clean air. It's nice to live here in the summer -you can swim, sunbathe and ride a bike, walk in the park and there are few people around.

**Fedor**<br/>
Nature is what will remain after me and after all of us. It is more sophisticated than any of the most ingenuine human intentions and inventions. Probably, I feel so because of the extreme beauty of the sky, which rarely shows how beautiful it is.

**x2**<br/>
I treat nature as a friend who will always help and share strength and calmness.

**Vladimir Zhuravlev**<br/>
All St. Petersburg residents usually miss the sun over the winter, so they go abroad to resorts, but I do not like to relax in resorts. I feel good alone. I just go somewhere 10 minutes away from Lomonosov, where there is no people, and I sunbathe in the tall grass, collect willow-herb, raspberries, and later mushrooms. I take fotos of wildlife, flowers and birds.
