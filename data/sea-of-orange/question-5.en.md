**Olga S.**<br/>
For me, the most surprising thing is that the city was not captured by the Germans during the World War II. The city did play great role in the defense of Leningrad. It's a small town after all, and I'm proud that it and its inhabitants were so resilient and strong. Thanks to this, the palaces were not destroyed, as in Peterhof, which has been completely restored.

The first thing that I heard about Oranienbaum (Lomonosov) was that somewhere here there is a huge stone head sticking out of the ground. That there were huge Russian slides being built. That Lomonosov has never actually lived here.

**Fedor**<br/>
The most amazing thing...but the thing is that it actually happened not in the Lomonosov, but in the area nearby, which is officially considered as a part of the city... So, the most crazy thing is that there were mummified burrials in Martyshkino, and that even the horses of
Peter the Third of Holstein was buried in a similar way. It's just something
out of the ordinary. And a couple of mummies can now be seen in
our local history Museum.

**Svetlana Zhuravleva**<br/>
When I learned that many famous people were in Oranienbaum: Pushkin, Nekrasov, Levitan, Shishkin, Dumas, Chaliapin, Komissarzhevskaya, and many others, even Lenin and Stalin, and Mikhail Lomonosov has never been here!

**Maria Zhuravleva**<br/>
The stories about ghosts in the palaces of Lomonosov or the skeleton found during the excavations of the Menshikov Palace. The amazing thing is that Oranienbaum-Lomonosov always had some independence, isolation and face, it had never been bend or won. It is surprising that the high ledge along the coast is the shore of the ancient sea, that blocks of granite are everywhere, and that the water in taps is underground water that flows from the ancient underground layers.
