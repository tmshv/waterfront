excerpt: >
     Sea of Orange is an architectural and artistic project implemented by the Waterfront project team together with partners from the Dutch architectural
     bureau Observatorium (Rotterdam). The project, aimed at integrating public art into public spaces, is based on the ideas of co-design and placemaking,
     so its main feature is cooperation with local residents, their involvement in the process of planning and creating an art object.
