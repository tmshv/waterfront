Two parks, two uses but one dream. The Menshikov Palace Park and the Sea of Orange both celebrate nature and the imagination. One is from the past, the other is for the future. Nowadays, the Sea of Orange is no man’s land. How can you turn this 'space into a place'?

The first impulse is the Dune of Orange. A free for all land art project to mark a new future for the Amber Beach aka Sea of Orange. A place-making project with and for the people of Lomonosov in order to create an imaginative public space. The Dune of Orange is an impulse for creating 'your own park by the sea' to celebrate what is 'already there': history, mystery, landschaft, and people.

During the opening event a day at the Sea of Orange, we stand on a manmade dune overlooking a park on the waterfront, we think of a future for art and culture and we standstill to look at the world in peace and quiet. The Dune of Orange is a first artistic impulse that hopefully creates an impact for the future. From no man’s land to an observatory to look at the world around us.
