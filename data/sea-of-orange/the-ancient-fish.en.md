Once upon a time on the waterfront of Lomonosov...

...ancient fish got out of the sea. It was not yet Lomonosov or even Oranienbaum, it was the ancient coast of the nameless ancient sea. The sea was deep, and the fish crawled up the steep, sloping bottom for a long time until the surface of the water appeared. Then they hovered for a couple of millennia at the surface to gain courage, and then they surfaced, adapted to the air and decided to grow fingers and claws on the fins, and looked back and happily turned over and decided to continue living on earth (and eventually turned into a man)

...and they liked it!

## QUESTION #1

**Tatiana Kiskina**<br/>
The beach is a great potential for the further development of the city

**Olga S.**<br/>
Quiet, green, coastal, calm city with fresh sea air.

**x1**<br/>
The city is in oblivion, quiet, deserted, but full of caring people.

**Svetlana Zhuravleva**<br/>
Lilac-apple city with white nights, Russian Switzerland. The city with a stunning view of the bay, where all the railways, sea, air, historical roads converge, full of interesting and interested residents.

**Maria Zhuravleva**<br/>
Oranienbaum is a city-warrior, city of fortitude and victory,of sea and parks, of sailors, palaces, silence and fresh wind.


## OBSERVATION #1

![](/assets/sea-of-orange/sorange_si_11.jpg)

**Albina Motor, producer, ideologist of “Waterfront” project:**
After reviewing all locations the common decision was to choose Lomonosov for some reasons: compare to other locations there are already active citizens that are trying to do something for the wider audience on the area; it’s “no-man’s” land; there is potential to involve local people to the place as co-creators and participants.

**Ruud Reutelingsperger, Partner at Observatorium:**
Lomonosov aka Oranienbaum is a small town on the Finnish Gulf. About 30 km from the city center of St Petersburg. When you visit the city one passes the world-famous Peterhof Summer palace and from there one can go to the, almost as famous, Oranienbaum Palace of Menchikov. This impressive palace with a beautiful park and traditional sculptures, was the starting point for the growth of the city and it’s fisherman’s harbor. Later a ferry-terminal came to town that connected Lomonosov with Kronstadt on the other side of the sea. A container terminal was planned but due to the building of a new damm - to protect the region from the stormy waters and sea-level rise - and the protest of the local community the terminal was placed somewhere else. The ferry terminal was ultimately shut and the waterfronts of Lomonosov became unused.

**Lieven Poutsma; Partner at Observatorium:**
Because of the palace and the possibility of going to the waterfront the local community wants to attract more tourists and (maybe even more important) want to restore the connection to the sea again for their own inhabitants. Many stories, over the centuries have been written about the relationship with the sea and the waterfronts around St Petersburg. These are always a little ambiguous. ‘Yes’ we love the river Neva and the Sea and ‘No’ we don’t do much with or on it. The Waterfront Neighborhood & Community project wants to address this issue in various ways. Exhibitions, site-specific events and a research program that combines thinking and doing and in collaboration with many organizations and communities. The sea, the rivers and the waterfronts are in the focus of everybody's intentions also because the growing and densifying city of St Petersburg needs ‘places to breathe’. Places that are clean and natural. Places good for flora and fauna and therefore good for people. Where you can smell, hear and see the changing of the seasons. Where you can
look at the horizon and put your feet in the water. The people we met tell stories. Lot’s of stories and if you ask further and deeper the ‘crazier’ they get.

**Evgeniy Zakharov, citizen of Lomonosov, activist, President of Oranienbaum Maritime Festival** ‘Thanks to Waterfront we met “Observatorium”. It is a totally new approach of working on the place for us, we were inspired by the public talk, workshop and private discussions with the team of such interesting high professional artists, architects and organizers of projects. We are trying to promote the no-man’s piece of land in the city on the waterfront as the new public space for years and now we have like-minded partners who gave new ideas for development of the place. We got the positive feedbacks about the news that we probably will do an art project on the location from different inhabitants through social media. Of course there some risks and political issues, but participation of reputable partners from Rotterdam and St. Petersburg in the face of projects will help us to find a way to establish dialog with the city authorities and business, and I'm happy that Lomonosov has chance to be an experimental platform of “place- making” approach for the whole region of St.Petersburg’

## QUESTION #2

**Olga S.**<br/>
So far, it is a deserted and rather uncomfortable place between the railway station and the old port.

**Fedor**<br/>
Wind, sun, light, sea, swell.

**x2**<br/>
The unrevealed potential of a social facilitator.

**Svetlana Zhuravleva**<br/>
While not amber. They say that somewhere on the beach there is a drain pipe with sewage... But in future, perhaps, it will be a cozy, beautiful and romantic place close to the bay.

**Vladimir Zhuravlev**<br/>
Once, KGB scammers brought stolen sand and illegally filled up the bay in the center of Oranienbaum, depriving the city's residents of access to the only place where they could rest at the water's edge. But the birds and fish took revenge on them, and the sand became a beach and a place for holidays and parties.

**Maria Zhuravleva**<br/>
A sea buckthorn miracle, the shore of dispute, struggle, victory and hope.
