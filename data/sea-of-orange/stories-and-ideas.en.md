excerpt: >
     Sea of Orange is an architectural and artistic project implemented by the Waterfront project team together with partners from the Dutch architectural
     bureau Observatorium (Rotterdam). The project, aimed at integrating public art into public spaces, is based on the ideas of co-design and placemaking,
     so its main feature is cooperation with local residents, their involvement in the process of planning and creating an art object.

The first phase of the project was to get to know the area and ask the local residents to share their memories and dreams for the future of this region by means of workshops and a walking conference. These memories, fairytales, drawings, dreams, stories and ideas were made by participants of the workshops who came from Lomonosov and St Petersburg and were a start of the imaginitive transformation of this site.
