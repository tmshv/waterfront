**Olga S.**<br/>
There was a holiday in the Lower garden. It was summertime, the sun was shining, and my grandparents and I were walking along the alleys.I remember the Park and palaces quite abandoned, they have not been restored for a long time, but in this form they seemed more alive and close to their past, and this had its charm.

**x1**<br/>
I was only in the Park and for a very short time. The feeling of a Museum,stagnation, timelessness. No life, everything around resembles postcards or showcases of past eras

**x2**<br/>
Ruined, sunny, floral.

**Svetlana Zhuravleva**<br/>
A closed gate to the courtyard of the Menshikov Palace, a great desire to go there, a field of sand, the wings with a crown at the top of the building, and a ladder on which you can run and jump.

**Vladimir Zhuravlev**<br/>
Previously, the Menshikov Palace was a secret naval Institute, then it was made a Museum, and they began to charge a lot of money for the entrance, so many residents of the city can not afford the ticket price.
