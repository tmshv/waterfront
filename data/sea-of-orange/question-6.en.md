**Tatiana Kiskina**<br/>
I was here this summer with other urban workshop, not by my own. I liked that the beach is so close to the railway station. It seems that is cool to have a place to relax right in the city and not to go 100km away from it. I was unable to see the entire city, but it is so sad to see all these abandoned buildings around.

**Fedor**<br/>
I rarely go to the beach. Only a few times a year.
Either I walk with friends, or I come to wander alone. To admire the bright St. Petersburg sky and to look at the colorful ships with containers? to feel the warm summer wind.

**Vladimir Zhuravlev**<br/>
In summer, when the weather is sunny, I come here by bike to sunbathe in the center of the mound of sand..
I never swim in the bay because water is dirty. I only sunbathe in a thicket of sea buckthorn. There are never other sunbathers, so you can sunbathe without clothes. Usually all sunbathers sit on the shore, fry kebabs, drink beer and look at the bay. And I look at the sea buckthorn, the sky and the sun.

**Maria Zhuravleva**<br/>
I always come here in August, during the Oranienbaum Sea festival. And once a year, to have some long, friendly conversation.
I talk to people, look at the sea. Once I was lucky enough to spend the night in a tent, but it is uncomfortable without the festival around because it seems unsafe.
