Place-making starts with a conversation on finding shared ambitions and dreams. Story-telling triggers the imagination and is one way to share the project in the community.

## THE SEA OF ORANGE AND IT’S MANY STORIES UND USES!

Once upon a time, not so long ago, in a small village on the coast of the Neva Bay business- men thought up great plans. “Let’s create some new land and build a harbor, so we can profit from the goods that are transported to the neighbouring rich big city.” They visited Rotterdam, this famous city in the Netherlands, just like Tsar Peter once visited Rotterdam. They were amazed by the big port and terminals and celebrated their idea in the Oranienbaum Beer Brewery. “Yes, that is what we want”. No sooner said than done. They searched all over the country to find good sand, they took and shipped it and started dumping it in the sea. !

The local citizens did not realize what was happening. What are they doing? What is happening to our seashore? Soon they found out the business-men planned a containerterminal in their village. Was it already too late to stop this, in their eyes, megolomanic madness? The protest began. !

As the locals came into action an elderly woman strolled through the park of the Palace. She was thinking about the past. How was it in the early days? People then also had big plans. One man in particular thought: “I will build a palace just as large and beautiful as the one of the Tsar, so he can visit me and I will profit from his wealth” No sooner said than done. Next to a small settlement wit- hout a name the grand construction began and nobody protested. !
One day the Tsar wanted to visit the palace by boat, but the palace didn’t have a port. Within three days a canal was dug from the sea right up to the palace – with the ‘help’ of the villagers. The ow- ner of the palace was so happy the Tsar would come and built him a giant present. A huge slide was erected in the palace park. It was extraordinairy and outreageous and copied many years later by Americans who turned this marvelous idea into the first roller-coaster in the USA –with the help of Russian immigrants.!

Slowly the small settlement grew larger and it felt it had to have a name. The locals were thinking and thinking but couldn’t agree. As they were discussing again, out of the mist a ship appeared. The saw an orange tree on deck - something they had never seen before. It was a gift from some foreigner – from Germany or Holland, nobody knows anymore – but it looked so magical that they decided to call their city Oranienbaum. And everybody agreed.!
Decades past, the world changed drastically as did the village of Oranienbaum. The Palace lost it’s grandeur and someone decided the name of the village had to change too. This somebody, some- where wrote on a piece of paper; “from now on we call your village; Lomonosov.” Why? Nobody knows. Many well-known people visited Oranienbaum but Lomonosov was certainly not one of them. Unfortunately, in those times protesting was useless.!
In the meanwhile the protesters against the new port won their battle and the only remains of this once great plan, was the double-colored - brown underneath and orange on top - sand area dum- ped in the bay. The locals took a deep breath of sea air and continued happily their daily routine. The old lady went back to her house overlooking this piece of orange sand that now was the view from her house.!
Years passed and nature took over the sandy area. Flowers and bushes and a remarkable plant with orange berries started to grow here. Nobody was sure where it came from but when they all bloomed at the same time, it looked amazing – a sea of orange plants. People strolled and relaxed on this new piece of land that didn’t exist in the records of any government and called it ‘Amber beach’. It was forgotten by the authorities, it was no-man’s-land. If something isn’t owned by so- mebody, it might become anybody’s property. So it happened that one day somebody wrote on a piece of paper: “let’s build the outlet of the sewer system right here”. No sooner said than done! Nobody ever thought of protesting, because nobody knew!!
Today the world is again in very different shape. The village is not as isolated as it is, being con- nected to the ‘big big’ world. The villagers are traveling all across the country and the planet and seeing many beautiful things incities and villages, squares and streets, parks and beaches and they get inspired by all the lights, smells and sounds of the world. When they arrived back home at their train station they wonder; “can we turn our Amber Beach into something similar?” They thought of yachtships, swimming in the sea (like in the old days), more nature, cleaning up the rubbish, looking out over the sea to the lights on the other side, dog walking rails, rest and quiet, monuments and artworks, your feet in the water and head in the sky, a labyrinth, a banana slide, barbeques... Many ideas - big and crazy or little and gentle – were discussed. And the people tal- ked... and talked... and talked. How to start? And over and over again they talked and they couldn’t stop talking anymore.!
The old lady saw and overheard all these debates. She took a shovel and walked to the beach and started to move sand. “What are you doing?” the people asked her. “I come from a time when the Park in the Palace was just for the rich. I come from a time where parks were only created for mo- numents. I want our beach to be a park for everybody in our village - whatever it’s name is. I want children to be able to swim in the sea and I want to sit on a hill and look over the water and wonder about the stories, legends and mysteries that lie behind the horizon. So, I am creating a hill, a dune for people to visit and for nature to grow.”!
The people looked at her and ran home, grabbed shovels and helped her. After three days the dune was completed. In the sand they had found rocks and everybody wrote his or her dream for the future on them.!

It is called the Dune of Orange. Every year the peace and quiet of this place on the waterfront is celebrated during Orange Night. In the distance you can see the light of the big city and through a fire on top of the dune a message is sent to the other side: we are connected.!

Today you can walk along the waterfront, swim in the sea, look at the passing boats and wonder about how nature thrives once you give it space. Today you can visit the Menschikov Palace and Park and the Sea of Orange; a marriage between past and future, young and old citizens, the city, the sea and the park. Now the Sea of Orange is no longer no-man’s-land. A ‘space’ has turned into a ‘place’. It was adopted and created by the people of Lomonosov. The Sea of Orange Park has become their own, because it is made and maintained for and by themselves and is free-for-all.
