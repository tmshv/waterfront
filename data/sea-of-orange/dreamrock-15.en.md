I was born in 2008<br/>
I was supposed to be a Container Terminal<br/>
But people didn’t want me<br/>
Now I’m an orphan waiting to be adopted<br/>

I was born in 1963<br/>
I come to the beach every day and look at the horizon<br/>
I smell the water, I hear the sounds of waves<br/>
and I see a light in the distance<br/>
I hope that one day more and more people<br/>
come to join me<br/>
Inspired by the sense of place<br/>
That they join me in thinking about the other<br/>
side and put their feet in the water and wonder<br/>
what does the other side of the sea looks like<br/>

I was born in 1977<br/>
I travel and see the world by bicycle<br/>
I dream of one-world, one people<br/>
I sense my town is changing<br/>
And I want the young to raise their voice<br/>
And show their creativity<br/>
