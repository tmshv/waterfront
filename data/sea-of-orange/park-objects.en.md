One day you will enter the Sea of Orange Park. A big gate welcomes you to enter the park that is full of mysterious objects. What are they here for? Who put them there? Nobody knows who made them. Is it art? Are they objects brought by aliens? You can sit on them, you can play with them and they lead you through the park. Maybe they are so beautiful because you donâ€™t know exactly what they are. They trigger the imagination. Hopefully they will be here forever and invite people to standstill and look at the world around you. Six objects, like brothers and sisters, are one family.

1. a doorway to the sea
2. A plastic object
3. Swings and wind
4. Objects along the alley
5. Observation platform
6. A metallic object
