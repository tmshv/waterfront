**Olga S.**<br/>
The city is necessary, it it is impossible to live without it. But it is more about work, socialization, culture, tension and restrictions. I like cities, but not too big, like Moscow - it's just vast, and there is a difficult rhythm of life. Saint Petersburg, in my opinion, is much more pleasant for life, but, of course, our climate is not always good.

**Fedor**<br/>
To the city, to St. Petersburg. To my image of it. I have thought many times that it is beautiful as a work of art, and ideal as a basis for a dramatic work of art, especially for a literary one, but rather dismissive in relation to a person. But it was conceived this way. In my opinion, it is classic and cold and does not allow an imperfect person to approach it.

**x2**<br/>
If we are talking about Lomonosov, than it is very cozy and diverse. In general,however, I feel myself uncomfortable in the cities because of the large number of people and noise.

**Svetlana Zhuravleva**<br/>
I treat Lomonosov with love and thrill--this is my small homeland.

**Vladimir Zhuravlev**<br/>
I study the history of the city of Oranienbaum, write articles and books about it. I participate and even organize environmental round tables, where we discuss different ways how we can protect the city. I participate in various scientific and creative projects, although recently, less and less often. Because I'm focused on my projects. I have not much time, but there are lot of plans for the future.

**Maria Zhuravleva**<br/>
I feel myself in the city like in my own apartment â€“ safe and calm. The longer I live here, the more I love every corner. A walk through the streets gives strength and inspiration, the view of the bay from a high ledge inspires me.
