The Fire, A Tree, A Ship, The Slide, A Barbecue, The Tower

Many stories and over the centuries have been written about the relationship with the sea and the waterfronts around St Petersburg. These were always a little ambiguous. ‘Yes’ we love the river Neva and the Sea and ‘No’ we don’t do much with or on it. The Waterfront project wants to address this issue in various ways. Exhibitions, site-specific events and a research program that combines thinking and doing and does this in collaboration with many organizations and communities. The sea, the rivers and the waterfronts are in the focus of everybody's intentions also because the growing and densifying city of St Petersburg needs ‘places to breathe’.

Places that are clean and natural. Places good for flora and fauna and therefor good for people. Where you can smell, hear and see the changing of the seasons. Where you can look at the horizon and put your feet in the water.

The people tell stories. Lot’s of stories and if you ask further and deeper the ‘crazier’ they get. The project ‘The Sea of Orange’ starts from there; Storytelling.

The fire<br/>
Across from the beach of Lomonosov one can not feel other than ‘awe’ about a ‘thing’ on the other side of the water. The Gazprom headquarter stands like the ‘Tower of Sauron’, a landmark of capitalism on the shore and visible all the time. People love it or hate but always feel the need to create a counterpart. In this case a local artist proposed to build a big fire on the beach. A fire that produces something (he is a ceramist). A fire to attract attention but also to protect.

A Tree<br/>
The origin of the name Oranienbaum is somewhat uncertain but as there are orange trees around the site of the waterfront and in the palace the people see the tree as a symbol for their town. If one looks from the sea towards the land people dream of a giant landmark in the shape of a tree. Or even 3 trees that are also viewing points. Not just to look at the see but possibly to the city as well and if it is high enough one can even see the Oranienbaum Palace.

A Ship<br/>
The ferry was not only a means of transportation but also an important meeting point - like all ferry terminals in the world. Ships bring and take goods to and from all over the world. Ships carry people to and from and work. To restore this ferry feeling it could be possible to build a ‘crazy’ ship that sails back and for the waterfront or that is stranded on the beach. A ship as a work of art, a ship as a symbol for dreams and wishes of the common people like the palaces were once the dreams of the aristocracy.

The Slide<br/>
The build slide is a Russian invention. Maybe common knowledge for the Russian people themselves but as a foreigner it is an ‘eye-opener’. Especially when you look at the pictures. What do you need to say more?
Could the slide be a work of public art. Can it carry people but even more so ‘ideas’. Could it be the roller-coaster of changing perceptions?

A Barbecue<br/>
On the first publications of the Waterfront Project you see a BBQ. It is an important cultural expression. It talks about going out, about meeting each other and the feeling of freedom; one leaves the confines of the house and enters the landscape. Is it possible to create a BBQ place and organise a storytelling event. The BBQ place becomes an Arti-Tecture. In between Art and Architecture. And maybe we organise the 1st Baltic or World Championship: The Art of BBQ.

The Tower<br/>
From the beach of Lomonosov you can see The Tower on the other side. The Tower is power. The symbol of capitalism and destroying Mother earth. It is the headquarter of Gazprom. At night it shines like the tower of Sauron. How can we destroy this golden ring of money and pollution and built our own defense tower to fight for a new kind of ecology, cleaning up the beaches and create a place for flora, fauna ánd people?
