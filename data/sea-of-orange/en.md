     Sea of Orange is an architectural and artistic project implemented by the Waterfront project team together with partners from the Dutch architectural
     bureau Observatorium (Rotterdam). The project, aimed at integrating public art into public spaces, is based on the ideas of co-design and placemaking,
     so its main feature is cooperation with local residents, their involvement in the process of planning and creating an art object.

# Sea of Orange

How can the shoreline of the city of Lomonosov (aka Amber Beach) be transformed into an attractive, inclusive and sustainable public space? The coastline at Lomonosov, a city near St Petersburg, is an isolated area that lacks a sense of ownership. The local residents want to turn this ‘space into a place’.

By using the language of imagination, the methodology of place-making and through storytelling, the Waterfront project (Street Art Research Institute) in St Petersburg and artist collective Observatorium from Rotterdam, are, step-by-step, transforming the present and future of the Amber Beach and together with local residents turn it into the Sea of Orange.

> Stories become objects.
> Objects turn a space into a place.
> The place is owned by the local people.
> The people clean up the beach.
> The beach becomes an new waterfront park.
> The park is called ‘Sea of Orange’

The goal of the project is to raise curiosity for contemporary public art and it’s different meanings and to adress a new urban ecology. It is about providing knowledge and hands-on tools for creating works in public of a high quality in accordance to local dreams and experiences. We subscribe the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

The Sea of Orange is the prelude to the future transformation of the site into a recreational and cultural spot on the waterfront with a new kind of biodiversity (what is good for flora & fauna is good for people).

Note:
Although we had to postpone the project for over a year, the world wide Covid 19 pandemic made us realise, all the more so, how important it is to ’take care of our planet and our fellow citizen’s’.

The Palace of Menchikov and it’s park in Lomonosov were built hundreds of year’s ago and one was only permitted to enter if you were part of the rich and famous, the nobility. The buildings and the park had no direct access to the sea. The Sea of Oranget is about creating, what Observatorium calls, a ‘built proposal’; a first imaginative step in transformation.
The Sea of Orange will be the counterpart of the Menchikov Palace and Park. Open for all people and with easy access to the sea/waterfront. The similarity between the old and the new however is that through the park/landscape design, the artworks and the pavilions, both places will trigger the imagination. We will built a landart project and thus we will create a new seashore park that addresses the rising of the sea-levels and biodiversity.

The history of the palace and the city of Lomonosov is being transferred by books, poetry and storytelling. For the Sea of Orange we will start a collection of stories that will become the heritage of the future and at the same time a guide for future additions to the park. All the team members envision that, through the Sea of Orange project, ultimately the waterfront will be adorned with extraordinary artworks and/or pavilions set in a contemporary, biodiverse maritime parkscape.

The objective is to create a ‘tidal park’ in which a new kind of biotope appears (as an example for the whole region and especially the city center itself). The tidal park as the counterpiece of the ponds in the park of the palace. A visit from 2021 on to Lomonosov will entail a visit to the Old Palace and the New Park by the sea.

The Sea of Orange project is also a cultural exchange between Russia and the Netherlands, Between the sister-city’s St. Petersburg and Rotterdam, Between the Waterfront project and Observatorium. It is a project to learn from eachother and give new insights in how to deal with waterfronts around city’s and how to transform them with local residents into attractive, inclusive and sustainable public spaces.
