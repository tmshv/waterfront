The local slope, on which the city is built, is a kind of hourglass or a clock. The only difference is that it measures millennia and not hours. It is associated with the beginning of one of the geological epochs, the age of which is measured by the alternation of layers in it. The slope marks the border of the glacier that stopped here, which also brought huge stones scattered throughout the city. Stones -- they keep secrets of children, secrets of games. Who in childhood did not arrange hiding places under stones? And such blocks seem to be whole mountains, they want to be conquered again and again. The beach still feels like something alien. Maybe by moving a couple of these boulders here, placing these familiar objects on top of a sand dune, we will make this place a little more familiar?
