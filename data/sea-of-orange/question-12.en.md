In 2009, at the end of February, bulldozers and excavators began to fill the bay with sand in the most beautiful place of Oranienbaum. I didn't like it, and I wrote to the Prosecutor's office, which told me that this is not the site of the port being filled, since there is no approved port project â€“ it is just a temporary sand warehouse in the bay. The name of the temporary sand warehouse is Lomonosov cargo terminal. After that, I wrote on the Internet, in the city newspaper, I was supported by active residents of the city, and at the hearing on the draft master plan of St. Petersburg (which includes Lomonosov), residents came out as a united front against the construction of a cargo port in the city center. At first, the authorities of the Administartion of Petrodvorets area did not want to listen to us, but friend of mine and I decided to organize round tables in St. Petersburg in defense of the bay against port alluvium. We were supported by Communist deputies in the legislative Assembly (Parliament) of St. Petersburg, who at meetings of the Commission on the city farm lobbied for the removal of the T5 alluvium from the General Plan of the port zoning, seeking the introduction of recreational zoning P1 for this territory. In 2014, the state government realized that the construction of a cargo port in the center of the closed city of Oranienbaum is not realistic. And the Oranienbaum Sea festival, organized by Yevgeny Zakharov, showed an example of how the territory of the former port terminal can be developed as a recreation area for citizens and yachtsmen. In addition, the Deputy of the legislative Assembly, Communist Komolova, secured funds for the creation of a project for architectural and landscape planning of the territory of Yantar and the Sidorov canals. The head of the studio, with whom we communicated at this time, asked me what name should be given to the future territory, and I said that the name "Amber" should remain. The amber itself is a beautiful sea stone of a sunny color. Let there be a new beach and recreation area called "Amber".

The story of how Menshikov came and saw an abandoned greenhouse with a tub with the signature "Oranien Baum", which became the prototype of the coat of arms of the city. The story of how they dug a canal in front of the Menshikov Palace overnight, so that Peter I could approach the Palace itself by sea. One day, sea buckthorn appeared on the beach, and it's amazing!
