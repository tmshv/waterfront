New buildings, new port, new jobs and a new park on the waterfront. A park to play and relax. A park for all the young and old people. A park that takes us to the future. The highway road along the coast will have a new exit that says: Sea Of Orange.	“I, as a resident of our city, represent the interests of other ordinary residents. Therefore, I will be glad if we would have a place where one can walk, breathe the sea air and admire the beautiful landscapes. To do this, I suggest building a pathway (bright green) through the greenery of the bushes. On this pathway, one could run and ride bicycles or scooters. We also need a children's playground with the roofs over the playing space in a shape of orange halves. One more thing is the separate barbecue area. And a zone for privacy, meditation and relaxation. It would be nice to place benches near the water edge. They could be of a color of sand to give the impression that one is sitting in the sand.”
