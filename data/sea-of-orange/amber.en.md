**A story about how the residents of Amber beach improved it**

One day a ship moored to the shore in Lomonosov. It had a bright orange color and seemed to glow. The beach was completely empty, there was no vegetation. And it was not clear to whom this beach belonged. However, locals often came to the beach to admire the beautiful sunsets and sunrises. But then people felt alarmed and were afraid to approach the ship, because the ship literally glowed and radiated (and apparently radiated strength and energy, but people did not know this yet). Moreover, it was strange for the townspeople to see a cargo ship near their shore, since they knew that there was a cargo port on the other side of the beach, where, perhaps, this ship was supposed to sail. But apparently the ship was damaged and some clear liquid was leaking out of it. Some time later, the ship sailed again. The next day, residents found huge clumps of sea buckthorn bushes on their deserted beach. Sea buckthorn looked so bright and juicy, glittering with gold, that it even somewhat resembled a precious stone-- the amber. Then the residents guessed that the cargo carried by the orange ship was succinic acid, which contributes to the growth and productivity of plants. Henceforth, the people of this beach began to bear the name Amber, and the city authorities were offered to give the beach to the General use and improve it, so that it became a point of attraction for all residents of Lomonosov and a kind of business card of the whole city of Lomonosov...And they (the city authorities) liked it!
