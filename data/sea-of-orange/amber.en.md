**A story about how the residents of Amber beach improved it**

One day a ship moored to the shore in Lomonosov. It had a bright orange color and seemed to glow. The beach was completely empty, there was no vegetation. And it was not clear to whom this beach belonged. However, locals often came to the beach to admire the beautiful sunsets and sunrises. But then people felt alarmed and were afraid to approach the ship, because the ship literally glowed and radiated (and apparently radiated strength and energy, but people did not know this yet). Moreover, it was strange for the townspeople to see a cargo ship near their shore, since they knew that there was a cargo port on the other side of the beach, where, perhaps, this ship was supposed to sail. But apparently the ship was damaged and some clear liquid was leaking out of it. Some time later, the ship sailed again. The next day, residents found huge clumps of sea buckthorn bushes on their deserted beach. Sea buckthorn looked so bright and juicy, glittering with gold, that it even somewhat resembled a precious stone-- the amber. Then the residents guessed that the cargo carried by the orange ship was succinic acid, which contributes to the growth and productivity of plants. Henceforth, the people of this beach began to bear the name Amber, and the city authorities were offered to give the beach to the General use and improve it, so that it became a point of attraction for all residents of Lomonosov and a kind of business card of the whole city of Lomonosov...And they (the city authorities) liked it!

## QUESTION #13

![](/assets/sea-of-orange/questions_25.jpg)

**Tatiana Kiskina**<br/>
I like the idea that the beach can be free of past history, and can be filled with stories of the future
Olga S.
As a place of rest with a view of the bay, with benches, bike paths, promenade, perhaps, a marina, like in small towns in Finland.

**x1**<br/>
As a place where there is no conflict between people and nature, they complement each other. As a place where you can come and have a quiet time, relax from the city clutter. Where is clean air and you feel yourself comfortable. Everything is extremely eco-friendly, natural and approachable.

**x2**<br/>
Clean and neat.

**Svetlana Zhuravleva**<br/>
With a promenade, with benches and playgrounds for children, maybe with a sports field for adults. It should be clean and worthy of the city.

**Vladimir Zhuravlev**<br/>
I think the bests scenarios is that the Master Plan should have a recreational zoning – a recreation and sports area without major facilities. How exactly this area would develop, it does not matter much, as long as there are no industrial zones. I am satisfied with the wild sea buckthorn thickets in the center of the beach, and the clean beach of new sand (now this sand is taken from the railway embankment of the military railroad), let there be some corners for sea sports and recreation. I would like to see yachting development. There should be old ships here, and even a Naval Museum on the water.
Maria Zhuravleva
There could be a great yacht marina with everything you need for yachting! And no sewer pipe, please!


## OBSERVATION #2

![](/assets/sea-of-orange/sorange_si_13.jpg)

In our part of the world it is evident that there is contemporary public sculpture, that the arts adress human rights or the UN sustainable development goals or climate change and new ecology. It is somewhat taken for granted that the arts are involved in these issues. Therefore maybe even ‘undangerous’. In and around St Petersburg however it is not so evident. Which means that Observatorium also has to re-invent themselves. In a place where public art and a gentle form of activism is not so common we need to find ways of incorporating, for us unknown local culture and local visual expressions.


## QUESTION #14

![](/assets/sea-of-orange/questions_27.jpg)

**Tatiana Kiskina**<br/>
Vasilievskiy island (of Saint Petersburg), or anywere close to big water

**Tatiana Kazak**<br/>
Close to the sea, but the warm one
Olga S.
In a place where interesting events happen regularly, where there are many like-minded people, where I can change something.

**x1**<br/>
Where the rights of all people are respected, where the comfortable housing is available, where people care about ecology and nature

**x2**<br/>
If we're talking about this region, then here in Lomonosov. Otherwise in a warmer place.

**Svetlana Zhuravleva**<br/>
There where I live - in Lomonosov.

**Vladimir Zhuravlev**<br/>
Here in Oranienbaum. I've been wanting to write a book "Marine Oranienbaum." I plan to do this soon. And to do this, you need to live here.

**Maria Zhuravleva**<br/>
In Lomonosov or in a village nearby -- from where you can see the bay.
