During a lecture Observatorium introduced the term Arti-tecture. It explains the core of our work. The projects are a work of imagination (art) and have a function (architecture). They are landmarks in their environment whether it is urban or rural. They are meeting- and viewing points and talk not only about history but much more about the future. They are a tool for place-making. The world is changing constantly at an even more rapid pace. Observatorium creates spaces to look at the changing world around you (if you move you donâ€™t see) and raise curiosity for the world around us. After the lecture a young female architect proclaimed; I want to be the first Russian Arti-tect!
