It necessary to notice, that the lights on the other side of the bay, are not the city lights, it's just the lights of the seaside road. So it creates a thin chain of lights, like a necklace, which divides the darkness exactly on the horizon. It's the best decoration for the city. Light is multiplied by reflection. The night light is a reddish light over the city and a cold blue light over the Bronka. Reflected in the overcast sky. In between this reflected light is the starry sky over Oranienbaum, peeking out from behind the clouds.

The triumphal arch composed of lights can become such a point of light, between the two patches of light, if it is positioned in the middle of the bay formed here. A pier can be built to it, so that you can admire the silhouette of the city and get a feeling of separation from the familiar world.
