It necessary to notice, that the lights on the other side of the bay, are not the city lights, it's just the lights of the seaside road. So it creates a thin chain of lights, like a necklace, which divides the darkness exactly on the horizon. It's the best decoration for the city. Light is multiplied by reflection. The night light is a reddish light over the city and a cold blue light over the Bronka. Reflected in the overcast sky. In between this reflected light is the starry sky over Oranienbaum, peeking out from behind the clouds.

The triumphal arch composed of lights can become such a point of light, between the two patches of light, if it is positioned in the middle of the bay formed here. A pier can be built to it, so that you can admire the silhouette of the city and get a feeling of separation from the familiar world.

## QUESTION #4

![](/assets/sea-of-orange/questions_7.jpg)

**Tatiana Kazak**<br/>
My first memory of the seashore is of my grandmother's story. She told me how after the lifting of the blockade it took her all day to get from the city center to Oranienbaum. Here in the coastal bushes there were battle boats on which her husband (my grandfather) served as an officer all the war.

**x1**<br/>
The first memory of the sea is from my geography classes back in school. We had to prepare reports about the sea explorers and to sigh all the seas and oceans on the contour maps. I remember how all theses seas seemed to be something vast, and I really wanted to understand what is the difference between White, Black, and Yellow seas? Is it the color?! When I first came to the sea coast, it was breathtaking. I wanted to see and remember everything, so it would remain forever in my memory. I wanted to sit down there and just watch around.

**Fedor**<br/>
For some reason, I always remember not the coast itself, but the lights around it.
Lights that are visible from the window of the train when late in the evening I return from St. Petersburg back to Lomonosov. Starting from Strelna-all a string of lights from the other side of the Bay skips across the road.Starting from Strelna, a chain of lights from the other side of the bay seems to glide in the air

Cold, quiet, bright.

**Vladimir Zhuravlev**<br/>
In 1982, when I was assigned to the city of Lomonosov after I had graduated from the Institute, I was placed in a dormitory of a military unit, where I was an engineer. We went swimming on the wild beach that was between the 40th Institute and the "Neptune" boat cooperative. There are memories of one girl that in the 60s the future Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky used to sunbathe and bathe there. That beach had clear water and a bottom of sand. Then I got married and moved to another part of the city. I had children. At this time, in the 1980s, a sewer pipe was configured through the entire city, where all fecal waste was collected, into the bay (at the future Amber beach). And when my little daughter and I came to the same place in the 1990s, we saw feces swaying on the waves, among which children and their parents were swimming. But we didn't go swimming there anymore.

**Maria Zhuravleva**<br/>
The very first memory-we came to Martyshkino village (now part of Lomonosov) on the "wild" beach, where my dad's (he worked at the factory back then) colleagues came regularly. When we changed our clothes and were ready to go to swim, I looked closer to the people in the water. They came in the bay as if raking the water in front of them. It appeared to be a thick layer of some dirt on the surface of the water, which my parents and I associated with the waste from the sewer pipe that still pours into the bay of Lomonosov. The desire to swim in Lomonosov in the Bay was gone forever. But I guess I have never had "the very first" memory of the sea, since I always had a horizon line in my life (seen from my home) and the water right up to the horizon line. There is no coast in the memories as such, there was a city and the dark sea as a part of it. Sometimes the sea was covered with ice, and it reminded me of my grandfather, who was the capitan of the icebreaker and used to serve in this dark sea. Later, the fascinating thread of lights of the dam appeared at the horizon line.
