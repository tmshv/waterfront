# Right to water

The educational and exchange project “Right to Water” is an attempt to comprehensively approach the problem of the development of water and coastal space.
The project is not commercial and exists thanks to the support of local residents. The group actively collaborates with other city associations, seeking to return the water space to all its inhabitants, and not just cars and seagulls. Being the sea capital, St. Petersburg, however, is practically not suitable for everyday coastal recreation.
According to the founder of the program, Olga Mnishko:

> “We want to understand why, with so much water in St. Petersburg, there is no mass culture of its everyday use.”
