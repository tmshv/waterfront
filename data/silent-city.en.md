# «Silent City»

«Silent City» is an app developed by specialists of the Institute of acoustic anomalies research for the study of objects AAO-, AAN- and AAZ-types.

If you are reading this text, it means that your access level allows you to join the research group. You need to download the app to your mobile device and visit AAO-type objects at the following addresses:
- 41 Chernaya Rechka nab. (the object is located on the bridge)
- Pryazhka river, Berdov Bridge
- 26 Nakhimov street (the object is located on the Central pier of the Galernaya Harbor)

After studying the psychoacoustic properties of AAO-type objects, you must submit a report (e-mail of the research group department: silentcity@waterfront.tools), the authors of selected reports will have temporary access to the study of AAN objects during the second phase of the study.

The following is the introduction of the dissertation on the topic "A comprehensive study of the origin, perception and psychological impact of acoustic anomalies of urban type on a person" by senior researcher Fluctus K. B.

***INTRODUCTION OF THE DISSERTATION (PART OF THE ABSTRACT) on the topic "Comprehensive study of the origin, perception and psychological impact of acoustic anomalies of the urban type on humans"***

## *Relevance of the topic*
*Sound anomalies were first described in detail at the end of the 20th century. Most of them are formed by low-frequency waves of natural origin. It should be noted that in some cases the question of the origin of the sound anomaly remains open.
At the beginning of the 21st century, the rapidly changing urban environment began to attract scientists' interest. In 2004, the theory of acoustic phenomena in the urban landscape was formed, but for a long time researchers could not find suitable experimental conditions for isolating anomalies from the vast array of data obtained, which was probably due to the noise-vibrating interfering effect of background signals from the city environment. The turning point came thanks to the emergence of a unique situation of Great Silence in 2020 (quarantine measures to combat the new coronavirus infection SARS CoV-2, ed.). A group of researchers from the Research Institute of Acoustic Anomalies (FSBSI RIAA) managed to establish the localization of several unique sound anomalies within the St. Petersburg (Russian Federation), conduct a number of studies of their nature and origin, and assess their impact on humans.*

## *Research methods*
*During the Great Silence, the determination of natural frequencies and vibration waveform (acoustic modes) of sound phenomena and their registration, did not require the use of supersensitive sound recording devices. However, as quarantine measures were canceled, more and more dynamic noise-generating sources began to appear in the urban environment. This required the development of additional structural and layout components of noise suppression, complementing the existing equipment, as well as the use of devices with the ability to detect spectral components in a wider frequency range.
For the experiment, a group of 32 volunteers was formed, which interacted with sound phenomena. Registration of stimulation of various hypothalamic centers was carried out, as well as an assessment of the involvement of neurons in the dorsal hippocampus in emotional-motivational excitation.*

## *Practical use*
*In the course of work, software was developed and patented. It allows visualizing the received sound signal. Currently, RIAA employees are adapting this software into a format available to users of mobile devices, which will help to collect and systematize a sufficient array of data for a more detailed understanding of the emotional and psychological impact of acoustic anomalies on a person.*

## *Conclusions*
*Urban acoustic anomalies, which until recently remained outside the field of vision of scientists, were recorded in St. Petersburg in 2020. A positive correlation was established between the interaction of a person with an acoustic anomaly and the formation of emotional-motivational arousal. Empirical evidence has been obtained that the musical-perceptual process, in which a person in contact with acoustic anomalies is involved, causes the optimization of mental state. Since the semantics of urban-type acoustic anomalies is currently a controversial issue, additional research will be required to clarify a number of issues.*
