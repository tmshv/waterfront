# Lecture by Christian Pagh

On November 21, a lecture by Christian Pagh was held at the HSE School of Design in Saint Petersburg. Christian is the co-founder and creative Director of Urgent. Agency (Copenhagen, Oslo), which combines the theory and practice of urban planning and architectural design. In his lecture "Urgent placemaking â€” public construction and creation of urban values", Christian explained what placemaking is and what significance this practice has for the development of a comfortable urban environment. He also explained why it is especially important to combine practical and humanitarian approaches in the field of planning and architecture, and shared his thoughts on the practice of urban planning in the light of everyday culture and social synergy.

How does architecture bring people together? Why do certain spaces become important to us? These questions formed the basis of Christian's lecture.
