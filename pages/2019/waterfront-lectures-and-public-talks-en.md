# Project sections, lectures and public-talks. 2019

As the project developed, Waterfront / Waterline attracted new experts to the dialogue about the problems of the use of coastal areas, organized lectures, open discussions and public-talks for all interested in urbanism, sociology, anthropology, architecture, design, and just curious people.

On February 2, a lecture by experts of the architectural bureau Orchestra Design Eduard Moreau and Catherine Goldberg was held at  the center for art and music of V. V. Mayakovsky Library. Eduard and Catherine told about social and cultural initiatives and presented a case with Lyubinsky Avenue in Omsk. In addition, they talked about the bureau's projects related to the embankments of the Moscow River and in the city of Yelabuga: how to move from a large-scale strategy to action through a socio-cultural program and the involvement of residents.

The meeting was held in the framework of the international Waterfront / Waterline project. In cooperation with the Danish Cultural Institute and with financial support from the Nordic Council of Ministers and the Nordic Council.

On February 17, another lecture was held at the same venue. This time Eduard Hyman, head of UI/UX design, visualization and analysis of urban data at Habidatum, spoke on How we communicate with the city through data. The lecture focused on trends in data-driven urban analytics, monitoring and predicting effects, and opportunities for urban development, infrastructure and the urban economy.
Edward told about the scheme and structure of the company Habidatum and presented case studies related to the analysis and visualization of spatio-temporal data.

The lecture was held as part of the series of meetings of the public program Citizens as co-authors of architects" of the Waterfront / Waterline project.

On April 26, projects Waterfront / Waterline and Who owns the River? organized a joint event. It was a lecture by the founders of the Observatory Studio. Lieven Poutsma and Ruud Reutelingsperger spoke about the role of local communities in the formation of river landscapes. The Observatory is an art project from Rotterdam that integrates artistic and architectural solutions into public spaces. 

Lieven Poutsma is an artist working at the intersection of art and architecture. His interests lie in the transformation of space â€” he can tell the story of a place through the integration of architectural objects that complement the environment.
Ruud Reutelingsperger is an urban researcher working on the transformation of industrial areas and industrial zones. He is sure that the prospects of art are closely linked with politics and urban development.

The lecture was supported by the Nordic Council of Ministers and Creative Industries Fund NL. The main partner of the project was HSE.
