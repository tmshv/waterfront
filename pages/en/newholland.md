# Man-made island "New Holland"

New Holland is a man-made island in St. Petersburg, which is closely connected with the naval history of the city. Cultural Urbanization is a modern project from Millhouse LLC to restore and reorganize the island into a modern public space while preserving historical architecture. The project includes, among other things, the restoration and improvement of the embankments of the Admiralty Canal and the inner water area of the island of Kovsha.
