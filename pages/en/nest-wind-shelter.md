# NestWindShelter

Temporary rapid installation on the beach of the Vasilevsky Island of St. Petersburg, designed to protect against wind russian BBQ - the site of a review tour on redevelopment of the water line and post-industrial areas of the Hanseatic cities - the program of the Chicago College of Architecture CCA Illinois Institute of Technology IIT in cooperation with the University of Hafencity HCU, Hamburg. 

15 students from Chicago, 10 young architects from St. Petersburg design::unit, Professor Martin Klaeschen, Daniyar Yusupov, Arseniy Konnov and the WaterFront project team.
The idea of the russian BBQ is to spend the evening under the lights of the WHSD, GLC and Lahta Center surrounded by the sea fa√ßade, in order to get acquainted with the new water line of St. Petersburg and the popular local social and cultural tradition of shish kebabbabbing on the seashore regardless of the weather conditions. 

It was this evening that the first snow fell under the strong Arctic wind.
Forty minutes, the participants of the event from 3-meter high bars and polyethylene erected a semicircular fence NestWindSchelter and additionally insulated themselves with life-saving blankets, which allowed a group of 30 people to stay outdoors for more than 5 hours.

The building was left to be used by other beach visitors. In the current conditions in Russia, it is necessary to create the infrastructure of this activity independently before carrying out any activities. First - infrastructure, then act.
