# Pianist performance on a raft that floats along rivers and canals

So far, the pianist has not planned the exact dates of his performance. Exactly only he knows one thing - at this time it should be warm and dark. Andreev also has other, no less grandiose plans, with the help of which he plans to draw attention to several social problems.

> “I'm going to perform on a raft that will sail along rivers and canals. I really want to thank the city. He not only educated me, but also filled my life with creative content, reflected through architecture, music, painting, poetry. I really love and appreciate Petersburg,” Andreev said.
