     The Okhta team took up the study of the eponymous river, which flows in the North-East of St. Petersburg. One of the main problems was the availability of 
     the Okhta coastline: the outline of its riverbed is hidden behind trees, bushes and thickets of hogweed, which significantly hinders free and safe access to 
     water. As part of the research, the Okhta team analyzed various aspects of the urban planning situation in order to find out how to transform the abandoned 
     space around the river into a comfortable and affordable recreation area for residents of the city and surrounding areas.

**Data collection and analysis methods:**

- Testing of hogweed control products
- Opening of the Hogweed Museum

**What has been done?**

The Okhta team paid a lot of attention to the research part, so the team members got a comprehensive view of the territory and neighboring areas. 
However, the participants note that at this stage they did not have enough communication with the residents and their involvement in the research process 
was not enough. Therefore, in the future, the Okhta team plans to achieve greater interaction with locals in order to jointly create a public space project 
on the Okhta river bank.
