excerpt: >
     The South-West coast is a pristine coastline on an alluvium in the historical district of St. Petersburg, which locals often call "Yuzy". 
     Along the newly laid Baltic Boulevard, a high earth mound and a wide stone ridge stretch, which offers views of the endless sky and the Gulf of Finland. 
     The South-West team was engaged in the research of this territory.

**What has been done?**

During the work, the team members managed to attract a sufficient number of local residents, introduce them to each other and unite them around the common goal. 
Thus, people were inspired to change their place as they want. The team also successfully implemented the planned projects and facilitated the communication 
between locals, local authorities and  and businesses.

The creation of temporary facilities within the workshops allowed to solve several tasks: to present in practice possible solutions that can be implemented within 
the framework of the future embankment project, to partially embody people's idea of the embankment and to promote the involvement of residents.

As a result of discussions, prototyping and creation of test solutions, local residents began to form an idea of what they would like to see in the future project 
of the embankment. In this way, social design and placemaking helped to start creating a community around a place and stir it up.
