# Race on Rubber Women on the Vuoksa River

The comic swim in rubber women turned into a long-term regatta, which managed to fall in love with many. However, in 2012, local authorities banned the event, citing high water levels. Despite the amateur status of this initiative, during each rafting the necessary safety measures were provided and thorough route checks were carried out. Whether the authorities are concerned about the safety of participants or tighter censorship is the reason for the ban, it is not clear.

> The organizers themselves argue that the sole purpose of the event is to promote a healthy lifestyle and the thesis "A rubber woman is nothing more than a means of transportation."
