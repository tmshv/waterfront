# SUP-surfing festival

The city portal "Fontanka.ru" holds the festival "Fontanka-SUP", which acquaints citizens with sapsurfing in all its splendor and simplicity!

SUP - from the English “Stand up paddle” - standing with a paddle. In Russia, such a board is simply called "glanders" or "padboard."

Originated from classic surfing, stand up paddle surfing is one of the most popular water sport in the world, and is just starting to get its fame in Russia. SUP has become an indispensable friend to surfers in the absence of waves, as you can surf on absolutely smooth water - using a paddle.
